Consumption of Controlled Drugs Overseas
The possession and consumption of illegal drugs outside of Singapore by Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents are still considered offences punishable by Singaporean law.

Specifically, Section 8A of the Act crimina​lises drug consumption overseas by Singapore citizens or permanent residents.

This is crucial for all outbound exchange students to note, as the consequences are severe:

Imprisonment for up to ten (10) years;

A fine of up to (but not more than) S$20,000;

Or both of the above penalties.

What is considered a "controlled drug"?
Please read carefully the full definition of a controlled drug in Chapter 185 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.

The list of examples of controlled drugs can be found on the Central Narcotics Bureau's​ website.​ Please note that this is not an exhaustive list.
