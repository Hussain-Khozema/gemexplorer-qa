Immigration (Passport and Visa)​
Students going on overseas exchange are responsible for researching and arranging all travel requirements by the host country, such as valid passport and student visa (if required).

These information may be found in your Acceptance Packages or email correspondence from your host university. You may also check your host country's embassy or immigration department (for example, British embassy in Singapore) in relation to your visa for the purpose of semester-long exchange.

If you are an international student, check if the embassies’ Singapore branch is able to accommodate your visa application. Do note that there are instances where visa applications are required to be processed in your home country (or a different country other than Singapore), hence, you may need more time to prepare. 

Documents for Application
Documents vary for each country's visa application, but they may include the following:

Official statement or proof of your exchange
Medical exam
Certificate of Clearance (COC)
Bank statement


Be aware of the time needed to prepare each document for your application as well as the application's processing time (may take up to 2 months) and administrative fees.
