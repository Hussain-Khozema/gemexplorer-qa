Hâ€‹ealth Insurance
Some host universities require exchange students to purchase their local health insurance that covers the duration of the programme.  In some instances, these are mandatory requirements either by the host university or as legally required by the host country.   Your host university would inform you accordingly if you are required to purchase health insurance in addition to NTU Group Travel Insurance.
