Course Planning
Before you apply for the GEM Explorer programme, you must thoroughly research information on the course offerings of your potential host university. Check if the host university has at least 15 - 20 courses that:

are available to you for the exchange semester you intend to go​

match those in your School for credit transfer*
*Irreconcilable course-matching issues could prevent you from embarking on exchange or transferring credits. Please note that it is your responsibility to find out whether or not the course is available to exchange students.



Be prepared for course (subject) planning to be an ongoing process until you enrol at your host university. ​Allow yourself some flexibility in the courses you want to take as that depends on what the partner university offers every semester – successful enrolment in these courses are subject to availability and fulfilment of pre-requisites.

Students are advised to reserve some electives to clear during exchange.

You may explore the following resources for course planning:
