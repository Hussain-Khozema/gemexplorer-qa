Allocation Criteria
Before you apply, you should understand how our selection process works so that you can maximise your chances of securing a host university.  

OGEM's selection process is guided by

the ranking of top three universities in your application

the no. of available spots per semester and no. of applicants to each partner university.

the priority of applicants as stated below.

The system shall place students on their 1st university choice first, based on set allocation criteria (priority), before moving on to allocate 2nd university choices to students who did not get their 1st university choice.


GEM Explorer shall select and prioritise students based on the following set criteria:

CN Yang SP, USP , TSP 
Scholars shall be selected for allocation first. However, the success of allocation still depends on the ranking choices and available vacancies.  Refer to the Scholars Guarantee for more information. Nanyang Scholars would then be allocated with a certain cap requirement.


Citizenship: Singaporean > Singaporean Permanent Residents > International students
Next, GEM Explorer shall pick applicants based on citizenship for allocation. Do note that ranking choices, CGPA, and availability have an impact on allocation.


Academic Performance
Next, OGEM will allocate based on academic performance. Applicants with comparatively lower CGPAs should be mindful of ranking only top-tier universities with limited spots. Students are advised to consider universities with vacancies of at least 20 or more.
 

Seniority  (only applies for last competitive spot)
Students at a more senior level with similar merits shall have a higher chance of allocation.


Students with prior overseas immersion experience (only applies for last competitive spot)
Students at a more senior level with similar merits and no prior overseas experience shall have a higher chance of allocation.


For research students, selection will also be based on your School's evaluation/interview.
