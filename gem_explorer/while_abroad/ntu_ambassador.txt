â€‹All GEM Explorer students should be ready to be NTU Ambassadors during their exchange programme. As explained, exchange programmes run on reciprocal agreements. In return for one NTU student going to a partner university, one student from the same partner university can study here.

Students are encouraged to do their part in enabling future exchanges the way that past Explorer students have enabled your exchange.

Besides being on your best behaviour, you should actively participate and volunteer in duties.

You can:

approach the global mobility / study abroad office at your host university and ask if you can participate, on behalf of NTU, in activities that promote exchange programmes.

Eg: Study Abroad fairs, Partners Day.

in the event that your host university does not have any activities/events, you may

prepare and conduct a short presentation about NTU or Singapore (you can ask for permission to present for 5 minutes before lecture.)

introduce NTU as a place to go on exchange for friends/peers at your host university
